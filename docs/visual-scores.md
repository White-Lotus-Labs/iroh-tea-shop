# Visual scores

Scores follow `docs/visual-rubric.md`. Shots come from the Metal run (1600×900 at 2x): headed in rounds 0 to 2, headless from round 3 on (see `docs/visual-rubric.md`). Shot folders are under `/Users/jackie/dev/tea-wt/_scratch/shots/`.

Frame rate is uncapped (no vsync) on an Apple M5 Max. "Min fps" is the slowest shot.

## Round 0 (baseline)

Shots: `_scratch/shots/round-0`. Frame rate: mean 296 fps, min 229 fps (`counter`).

| Part                   | Score | Reason                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lighting and shadows   | 4     | Heavy ambient and hemisphere fill flatten every form; one hard sun shadow; the tea set floats.  |
| Environment/atmosphere | 3     | No ceiling (grey beam undersides over a void); no haze or depth; the left wall is a black void. |
| Walls/architecture     | 4     | Painted backdrops read as flat stickers; left and waiting-room walls are blank plaster boxes.   |
| Floor and table        | 4     | Uniform orange planks with painted-on dark strips; pale pine table box; tatami are flat slabs.  |
| Tea set and steam      | 4     | Good teapot silhouette, but no contact shadow, flat dark tea, and the steam is invisible.       |
| Orrery                 | 5     | Rich mechanism, but the brass reflects nothing and reads as yellow plastic on a black wall.     |
| Mood/color grade       | 4     | One-note orange-brown, low contrast, no bloom on lanterns; 3D and painted layers do not match.  |

Host baseline (host lane owns these; scene lane does not edit them):

| ------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Face    | 5     | Strong photo skin, but it sits on a sphere with primitive ears.         |
| Eyes    | 5     | Painted into the photo; no wet highlight or depth.                      |
| Beard   | 6     | Good strand texture, but a flat card with a hard outline.               |
| Hair    | 3     | A grey helmet band with ribbed side pieces; the topknot is two spheres. |
| Hands   | 3     | Pale mitten shapes; the tone does not match the face.                   |
| Robe    | 6     | Good woven texture and layered collar; the sleeves are blobs.           |
| Posture | 4     | Symmetric and stiff; the raised left hand floats in the air.            |

GPU check: headless SwiftShader and headed Metal `room-wide` at 1x differ by a mean 0.14/255. Metal is the scoring renderer.

## Round 1: effects, lighting, architecture, surfaces

Shots: `_scratch/shots/round-1`. Frame rate: mean 101 fps, min 79 fps (`room-wide`).

Changes: `SceneEffects` (Lightformer environment, exp fog, 4x MSAA composer, half-res GTAO, bloom, grade and vignette), less ambient fill, warm key and cool fill, procedural colour/normal/roughness maps with world-scale UVs, board ceiling, framed left wall with scroll and andon, plank floor, tatami, walnut table and runner, paper lanterns, noren, darker orrery brass without emissive.

| Part                   | Score | Reason                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lighting and shadows   | 6     | Lanterns now motivate the light and IBL shapes forms, but lanterns clip white, the host is over-lit orange, the counter room is murky. |
| Environment/atmosphere | 6     | The room is closed and fog adds depth, but there is no haze or window light, and the left foreground falls to black.                   |
| Walls/architecture     | 6     | Posts, rails, wainscot and ceiling battens read well; plaster relief is lumpy up close; backdrops are still unlit.                     |
| Floor and table        | 7     | Planks vary in tone and grain with a soft sheen; tatami read as woven; the walnut table is too noisy up close.                         |
| Tea set and steam      | 4     | Unchanged: no contact shadow under the pot and cups, flat tea, and no visible steam.                                                   |
| Orrery                 | 6     | Brass reads as metal against the pale scroll, but the andon clutters behind it and it has no contact shadow.                           |
| Mood/color grade       | 6     | Warm, contrasty and cinematic, but saturated orange on skin and white-clipped lanterns cheapen it.                                     |

## Round 2: tea set, steam, contact shadows, lantern balance

Shots: `_scratch/shots/round-2`. Frame rate: mean 92 fps, min 73 fps (`tea-set`, full motion with steam).

Changes: glazed ceramics with clearcoat, amber tea with a glossy surface, torn-wisp steam sprites from spout, lid and cups, `ContactShadows` under the tea set and the orrery, ribbed chochin lanterns at a lower emissive, smoother plaster and finer floor grain.

| Part                   | Score | Reason                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lighting and shadows   | 7     | Lanterns glow without clipping and key shadows rake the counter floor, but lanterns cast no light pools and the counter is murky. |
| Environment/atmosphere | 6     | Fog gives depth, but the glowing shoji throw no light shafts and the air has no haze or dust.                                     |
| Walls/architecture     | 6     | The frame, wainscot and ceiling read well, but the right plaster wall reads as blotchy rusted metal.                              |
| Floor and table        | 7     | Floor and tatami hold up; the table top grain is stringy and aliased in the tea-set close-up.                                     |
| Tea set and steam      | 6     | Grounded by contact shadows, with glossy glaze and visible steam, but the uniform green glaze still reads as plastic.             |
| Orrery                 | 7     | Brass rings, planets and the glowing sun read clearly against the scroll; the dial face is flat and the andon clutters.           |
| Mood/color grade       | 7     | Warm dusk grade with controlled highlights; the palette lacks a cool counterpoint, so every view is orange-brown.                 |

## Round 3: merge of origin/main (Andrii's doorway and host diorama)

Shots: `_scratch/shots/round-3-merge`. Frame rate: mean 72 fps, min 47 fps (`room-wide`). These numbers are not comparable: another lane ran a headless Playwright job at about 635% CPU during the capture.

Changes: Andrii's `TeaHouseDoorway` (jamb posts, lattice ranma transom, side shoji, green noren, jamb lantern) replaces the old partition wall and my noren. The host diorama arrives from the host lane. No scene-lane art changes.

The new part "Prop and architecture detail" starts in this round (see the rubric).

| Part                         | Score | Reason                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lighting and shadows         | 7     | Unchanged. The doorway lantern adds a motivated warm pool at the counter.                                               |
| Environment/atmosphere       | 6     | Unchanged: no light shafts, haze, or dust.                                                                              |
| Walls/architecture           | 6     | The doorway frame and transom fix the blank counter partition, but the right plaster wall still reads as rusted metal.  |
| Floor and table              | 7     | Unchanged.                                                                                                              |
| Tea set and steam            | 6     | Unchanged.                                                                                                              |
| Orrery                       | 7     | Unchanged.                                                                                                              |
| Mood/color grade             | 7     | Unchanged.                                                                                                              |
| Prop and architecture detail | 4     | The counter and table are plain boxes, the pot is primitives, and painted backdrops hold the shoji, alcove, and plants. |

## Round 4: sculpted props, walls, light shafts

Shots: `_scratch/shots/round-4` (headless Metal from here on). Frame rate: mean 92 fps, min 70 fps (`counter`).

Changes: code-sculpted back wall (veranda with deck and railing, painted landscape kept only as a distant matte, lattice shoji, tokonoma with a calligraphy scroll), a framed right wall with a kumiko shoji in place of its painting, and neutral clay plaster. Veranda and shoji light shafts with dust motes (NaN-guarded). A lathe teapot with lid gallery, knob, hollow spout, and glaze break, cups with foot rings, and a tray, caddy, and scoop. A joined walnut table with tapered legs and a fringed runner. A hibachi brazier with ember charcoal and a hobnailed tetsubin. A framed counter with slats, canisters, a whisk, and a tray of cups. Back-bar shelving with labelled jars, a bonsai, bamboo, a tufted zabuton, a carved kanban signboard, and a customer-side lantern.

| Part                         | Score | Reason                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lighting and shadows         | 7     | The brazier glow and veranda shafts add motivated light, but the counter front and the tokonoma stay dim.           |
| Environment/atmosphere       | 7     | Shafts and motes read well behind the orrery and on the veranda; in the wide view they are almost invisible.        |
| Walls/architecture           | 7     | Real shoji, veranda and alcove replace the painted walls; the side-wall plaster panels are large and blank.         |
| Floor and table              | 7     | The joined walnut table and runner read as crafted; the table grain is still a little loud in close-up.             |
| Tea set and steam            | 7     | A sculpted pot, cups, tray and kettle with steam; the glaze needs more highlight breakup to reach a food-shot look. |
| Orrery                       | 8     | Brass glints against the dusk veranda, with a light pool, motes behind it and a contact shadow.                     |
| Mood/color grade             | 7     | The purple dusk through the veranda gives a cool counterpoint; the counter view is still murky.                     |
| Prop and architecture detail | 7     | Every prop the camera sees now has parts; the tokonoma and side walls are sparse, and the brazier box is plain.     |

## Round 5: counter light, tokonoma, brazier fittings

Shots: `_scratch/shots/round-5`. Frame rate: mean 85 fps, min 68 fps (`counter`).

Changes: a customer-side chochin that lights the counter front, a brighter tokonoma with a bronze koro, stronger shoji shafts, brass corners and ring pulls on the brazier box, and a sumi-e bamboo scroll on the left wall. The counter menu board moved to face the lantern.

| Part                         | Score | Reason                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lighting and shadows         | 8     | Every station now has a motivated key: lanterns, shoji, brazier embers, and the tokonoma downlight.   |
| Environment/atmosphere       | 7     | Shafts read on the veranda and behind the orrery; the wide view still shows little haze.              |
| Walls/architecture           | 7     | Joinery, shoji and alcove read as built; side-wall plaster stays deliberately plain.                  |
| Floor and table              | 7     | No change.                                                                                            |
| Tea set and steam            | 7     | No change.                                                                                            |
| Orrery                       | 8     | No change.                                                                                            |
| Mood/color grade             | 8     | The counter is no longer murky; warm interior against the violet dusk is consistent across all shots. |
| Prop and architecture detail | 7     | The brazier and tokonoma gained parts; small props are still sparse at wide framing.                  |

## Round 6: table grain, warm haze

Shots: `_scratch/shots/round-6`. Frame rate: mean 82 fps, min 65 fps (`tea-set`). The p95 frame time has single spikes near 33 ms on `counter` and `tea-set`, so watch these two shots.

Changes: calmer walnut figure on the table, with finer rings, less warp, and more streaking. A warmer, denser `FogExp2` (`#5c3c26`, 0.045) for aerial depth between the counter and the chamber.

| Part                         | Score | Reason                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Lighting and shadows         | 8     | No change.                                                                                       |
| Environment/atmosphere       | 7     | The haze softens the far wall; the wide view still has no visible beam.                          |
| Walls/architecture           | 7     | No change.                                                                                       |
| Floor and table              | 8     | The table now reads as oiled walnut in close-up; boards, tatami borders and joinery all hold up. |
| Tea set and steam            | 7     | No change.                                                                                       |

| Mood/color grade             | 8     | No change.                                                                                       |
| Prop and architecture detail | 7     | No change.                                                                                       |

## Round 7: veranda beam, tea color

Shots: `_scratch/shots/round-7`. Frame rate: mean 87 fps, min 71 fps (`tea-set`). The p95 spikes from round 6 did not come back (worst p95 18.8 ms).

Changes: the veranda shaft gain goes from 0.5 to 0.65, so the beam now reads in the wide view and on the tea-table view. The tea goes from red-brown `#5a2a0c` to amber `#7e4d17`, so it reads as hojicha, not wine, under the warm grade.

| Part                         | Score | Reason                                                                                |

| Environment/atmosphere       | 8     | Beam, motes and warm haze now show in four views: wide, tea table, host and orrery.   |
| Walls/architecture           | 7     | No change; the side walls are plain by design, but they keep this part below 8.       |
| Floor and table              | 8     | No change.                                                                            |
| Tea set and steam            | 8     | Sculpted pot, footed cups and amber tea with wisps; it reads as a crafted still life. |
| Orrery                       | 8     | No change.                                                                            |

## Round 8: real brush text, framed walls, coffered ceiling

Shots: `_scratch/shots/r8`. Frame rate: `room-wide` 72, `tea-table` 74, `counter` 69, `host-full` 86 fps. A first try with a 1024² plaster texture dropped the wide views to 52–56 fps. A bisect showed the texture caused the whole drop, so it went back to 512² with a 2 m tile.

Changes: every piece of fake text is gone. The counter kanban is one carved gold 茶 (tea). The menu stand reads 御品書 (menu) with four real teas and kanji prices. The jar labels name real teas (煎茶, 玉露, 抹茶 and others). The tokonoma scroll reads 和敬清寂, the four principles of tea. The walls gained wainscot stiles, bronze nail covers on the nageshi, stronger plaster mottling and soft edge grime in every bay. A staggered wall shelf with a bud vase and an incense box went up on the left wall. The ceiling is now plank boards on a batten grid with cross battens, a perimeter molding and lantern ceiling plates.

## Round 9: floor dressing, temae utensils, ranma

Shots: `_scratch/shots/r9`. Frame rate: `tea-table` 72, `brazier` 71, `room-wide` 67 fps.

Changes: a fifth tatami row, a second guest zabuton and a stack of spare zabuton. By the brazier: a lidded mizusashi water jar, a bronze kensui with a bamboo hishaku on its lid rest, and a folded fukusa. A two-panel furosaki byobu with gold leaf and an ink pine stands behind the brazier. A low lacquer hanadai holds a chabana and an incense stick; its smoke uses `Steam` and hides under reduced motion. Lit ranma with kumiko lattice fill the band above the veranda and the shoji. A new `brazier` review shot covers this corner.

| Prop and architecture detail | 8     | The brazier corner reads as a real temae setup; the jar is still plain cream.       |

## Round 10: counter life, waiting-room walls

Shots: `_scratch/shots/r10` (full set, 11 shots). Frame rate: mean 69.5 fps, min 55.2 fps (`counter`), with a load average of 12–16 from other agents.

Changes: a brass tenbin balance, a hand bell and stacks of wrapped pu-erh cakes (printed 普洱) on the counter and the shelf cabinet. The waiting-room side walls now use the same framed wall as the chamber, without shadow casting. The wall bays are de-duplicated, which fixed a duplicate React key warning. A new `entrance` review shot covers the first station.

## Rounds 11 and 12: scrolls, Shino jar, waiting bench, draw-call merge

Shots: `_scratch/shots/r11`, `_scratch/shots/abnow`. The machine was shared with other agents' headless browsers (load average 22 to 54), so single runs were not comparable. Frame rate comes from a paired test: the round 7 build and the current build back to back on the same shots.

| Shot        | Round 7 build | Round 12 build |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| `tea-table` | 50.5 fps      | 58.5 fps       |
| `room-wide` | 53.4 fps      | 47.8 fps       |
| `counter`   | 44.5 fps      | 49.9 fps       |

Before the merge, the same paired test showed the round 12 build about 20% slower (`counter` 40 fps against 52.8). The fix merges the tatami (45 boxes into two meshes), each framed wall (about 10 boxes into one mesh) and the wall grime (about 40 planes into one mesh per wall).

Changes: a second calligraphy scroll, 一期一会 (one time, one meeting), on the right wall; a Shino glaze on the mizusashi; a larger wall shelf with lighter wood and flush cleats. In the waiting room: seven wooden menu plaques with real tea names and prices, a waiting bench with a red mōsen and a teacup, and the bamboo ink scroll above it.

| Prop and architecture detail | 9     | Every station now shows sculpted, purposeful objects with real text; the wide views read as a lived-in shop. |

## Round 13: draw-call batching

A per-frame WebGL draw-call counter showed about 2,600 calls on the wide views. The scene had 738 meshes, 438 of them shadow casters, and the AO pass redraws the scene for normals. A new `Timber` helper in `craft.tsx` merges static timber boxes into one wood mesh. It now draws the doorway (about 55 boxes), the andon frame, the waiting-room shoji, the room beams and posts, and the right-wall and back-wall timber. Draw calls per frame went from 2,627 to 2,293 on `room-wide`, from 2,854 to 2,412 on `counter`, and from 2,428 to 2,140 on `tea-table`. The shots show no visible change.

## Round 14: box labels

Changes: paper labels with real tea names on the six paulownia boxes on the counter shelves, as one merged mesh with one atlas. A new `counter-shelves` review shot frames the shelves from behind the counter. A full-motion wide shot confirms the incense wisp above the flower stand.

## Round 15: hengaku

Changes: a framed calligraphy board (hengaku) reading 茶禅一味 ("tea and Zen are one taste"), right to left, hangs above the left-wall nageshi with its top tilted into the room. It fills the calmest band in the wide view and adds two meshes.

Frame rate: the capture after round 15 ran at a load average of 72 to 97. `host-face` fell from 82.8 fps to 52.3 fps, and round 15 did not change that view, so the whole run was CPU and GPU starved. Mean 53.5 fps; `shelf` 39.3 fps and `counter` 43.1 fps fell below the floor in that run. The round 14 capture below is the representative number for the final build.

One `npm test` run during this load spike showed 6 failures. Three reruns on the same commit passed 93 of 93, so the failures were timeouts, not regressions.

## Final summary

Final shots: `_scratch/shots/final` (12 shots, headless Metal, 1600×900 at 2x), captured after round 15. The frame-rate numbers below come from the paired run and the round 14 recapture, which ran at lower load. Build: `npm run typecheck`, `npm test` (93 tests) and `npm run build` pass. There are no console errors on any station.

### Final scores

| Prop and architecture detail | 4 (R3)  | 7       | 9     | Real text everywhere, temae utensils, counter scale, bell and tea cakes, plaques, scrolls. |

### Final frame rate

The machine was shared with other agents' headless browsers during the final run (load average 65 to 82). The round 7 build ran on the same stations right after, for a fair comparison.

| Shot            | Round 7 build | Final build |
| --------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| `room-wide`     | 55.7 fps      | 52.5 fps    |
| `counter`       | 50.0 fps      | 52.7 fps    |
| `tea-table`     | 55.9 fps      | 62.9 fps    |
| `host-full`     | 66.7 fps      | 65.2 fps    |
| `host-face`     | 80.4 fps      | 82.9 fps    |
| `host-hands`    | 63.3 fps      | 73.5 fps    |
| `tea-set`       | 52.1 fps      | 56.8 fps    |
| `observatorium` | 80.1 fps      | 84.9 fps    |
| `shelf`         | 59.4 fps      | 66.0 fps    |
| Mean (9 shots)  | 62.6 fps      | 66.4 fps    |

The table above is the paired run before round 14. The recapture after round 14 (load average 21 to 55) gave a mean of 67.3 fps over 12 shots. The lowest was `counter` at 55.5 fps. The review shots ran at 60.9 fps (`brazier`), 57.1 fps (`entrance`) and 78.9 fps (`counter-shelves`). Every station stays at or above the 50 fps floor, even under this load. On an idle machine, round 7 ran at a mean of 86 fps, so the final build has more headroom than these numbers show.

### What remains

- The upper plaster bands above the nageshi stay plain. This is correct for the style, but it is the calmest area in the wide view.
- Small props in the waiting room read well at the entrance, but the counter station still frames only the counter end of the room.

## Proposed

Items that need an off-limits file, a dependency, or a big architecture change.

- Thread the shell's in-app reduced-motion setting down to `ChamberDressing`. The incense wisp now reads the OS setting once, so the in-app toggle does not stop it. This needs a prop through `TeaRoom.tsx`.
- Merge static parts of the orrery (151 meshes) and of `TeaShelf.tsx` (86 meshes, Lane E). They are now the largest draw-call groups. Each mesh draws up to three times: main pass, shadow pass and AO normal pass.
- Bundle a small subset of a Japanese serif font (only the 40 or so glyphs the scene uses) for the canvas text. The text now uses the system mincho face (Hiragino, Yu Mincho, Noto Serif JP or MS Mincho), so the brush shapes vary a little by operating system.
